/*********************************************************************
IMPORTANT NOTES: This code can be readily adapted for use with the 
both the F and LF versions of the following devices:

PIC18F4553/4458/2553/2458
PIC18F4550/4455/2550/2455
PIC18F4450/2450
PIC18F14K50/13K50
PIC18F45K50/25K50/24K50

However, the default device that is currently selected in the project
may not be the device you are interested.  To change the device:

Replace the linker script with an appropriate version, and
click "Configure --> Select Device" and select the proper
microcontroller.  Also double check to verify that the HardwareProfile.h and
usb_config.h are properly configured to match your desired application
platform.

Verify that the configuration bits are set correctly for the intended
target application, and fix any build errors that result from either
the #error directives, or due to I/O pin count mismatch issues (such
as when using a 28-pin device, but without making sufficient changes
to the HardwareProfile.h file)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE FOR BUILDING WITH C18 COMPILER:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This project needs to be built with the full compiler optimizations
enabled, and using the Default storage class "Static" or the total
code size will be too large to fit within the program memory
range 0x000-0xFFF.  The default linker script included
in the project has this range reserved for the use by the bootloader,
but marks the rest of program memory as "PROTECTED".  If you try to
build this project with the compiler optimizations turned off, or
you try to modify some of this code, but add too much code to fit
within the 0x000-0xFFF region, a linker error like that below may occur:

Error - section '.code' can not fit the section. Section '.code' length=0x00000020
To fix this error, either optimize the program to fit within 0x000-0xFFF
(such as by turning on all compiler optimizations, and making sure the
"default storage class" is set to "Static"), or modify the linker
and vector remapping (as well as the application projects) to allow this
bootloader to use more program memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE FOR BUILDING THIS BOOTLOADER FIRMWARE WITH THE XC8 COMPILER:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
To build this code with the XC8 compiler, make sure to use the linker
option:
ROM ranges: default,-1000-XXXXXX   //Where "XXXXXX" is the last implemented flash memory
address, excluding the config bit region (ex: "default,-1000-7FFF" for the 32kB PIC18F45K50)
This setting is found in the XC8 compiler linker settings, Option category: Memory Model.

If any errors are encountered relating to "cannot find space", this
presumably means that either the compiler was configured to build the
code in Free or Standard mode, or that modifications have been made to
the code that have increased the code size to exceed the 0x000-0xFFF program
memory region.  If this error is encountered, make sure to build the project
with all PRO mode optimizations enabled, and/or optimize any user added code
that is causing the project size to exceed the 0x000-0xFFF region.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE FOR BUILDING APPLICATION FIRMWARE PROJECTS WITH THE XC8 COMPILER:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
When building the application project that is meant to be programmed by this
bootloader, you must use different XC8 linker settings as this project.
For application projects, two linker settings are required:

ROM ranges: default,-0-FFF,-1006-1007,-1016-1017
Codeoffset: 0x1000

When the above settings are implemented, the application firmware will no longer work
without the bootloader present.  Therefore, it is recommended to add the bootloader
firmware output (from this bootloader project) .hex file as a "Loadable" into
the application firmware project.  This will allow the "HEXMATE" tool to run
after building  the application firmware project, which will merge the application
output .hex file contents with the bootloader output .hex file contents (which was
added as a loadable file).

However, in some cases you may encounter build errors during the hex merge operation.
This will occur if there are any overlapping regions in the bootloader firmware
.hex file, with the application firmware .hex file, when the contents of these
overlapping regions are not 100% exact matches to each other.  Normally, only the
configuration bit settings will be overlapping between the two projects.

Therefore, to prevent build errors, the configuration bit settings between the
bootloader firmware project and the application firmware project must be set to
100% exactly identical values (or they must only be set in one of the projects,
to eliminate the overlapping region altogether).


----------------------Bootloader Entry------------------------------------------
Entry into this bootloader firmware can be done by either of two possible
ways:

1.  I/O pin check at power up/after any reset.  and/or:
2.  Software entry via absolute jump to address 0x001C.

The I/O pin check method is the most rugged, since it does not require the 
application firmware image to be intact (at all) to get into the bootloader
mode.  However, software entry is also possible and may be more convenient
in applications that do not have user exposed pushbuttons available.

When the "application" image is executing, it may optionally jump into
bootloader mode, by executing a _asm goto 0x001C _endasm instruction.  
Before doing so however, the firwmare should configure the current
clock settings to be compatible with USB module operation, in they
are not already.  Once the goto 0x001C has been executed the USB device 
will detach from the USB bus (if it was previously attached), and will 
re-enumerate as a HID class device with a new VID/PID (adjustable via 
usb_dsc.c settings), which can communicate with the associated
USB host software that loads and programs the new .hex file.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anytime that an application implements flash self erase/write capability, 
special care should be taken to make sure that the microcontroller is operated 
within all datasheet ratings, especially those associated with voltage versus 
frequency.

Operating the device at too high of a frequency (for a given voltage, ex: by
operating at 48MHz at 2.1V, while the device datasheet indicates some higher
value such as 2.35V+ is required) can cause unexpected code operation.  This
could potentially allow inadvertent execution of bootloader or other self
erase/write routines, causing corruption of the flash memory of the application.

To avoid this, all applications that implement self erase/write capability 
should make sure to prevent execution during overclocked/undervolted conditions.

For this reason, enabling and using the microcontroller hardware Brown-out-Reset 
feature is particularly recommended for applications using a bootloader.  If 
BOR is not used, or the trip threshold is too low for the intended application 
frequency, it is suggested to add extra code in the application to detect low 
voltage conditions, and to intentionally clock switch to a lower frequency 
(or put the device to sleep) during the low voltage condition.  Hardware
modules such as the ADC, comparators, or the HLVD (high/low voltage detect)
can often be used for this purpose.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This bootloader supports reprogramming of the microcontroller configuration bits,
however, it is strongly recommended never to do so, unless absolutely necessary.
Reprogramming the config bits is potentially risky, since it requires that the
new configuration bits be 100% compatible with USB operation (ex: oscillator
settings, etc.).  If a .hex file with incorrect config bits is programmed
into this device, it can render the bootloader inoperable.  Additionally,
unexpected power failure or device detachment during the reprogramming of the
config bits could result in unknown values getting stored in the config bits,
which could "brick" the application.

Normally, the application firmware project and this bootloader project should
be configured to use/set the exact same configuration bit values.  Only one set
of configuration bits actually exists in the microcontroller, and these values
must be shared between the bootloader and application firmware.

// ************** USB Callback Functions ****************************************************************
// ******************************************************************************************************
// The USB firmware stack will call the callback functions USBCBxxx() in response to certain USB related
// events.  For example, if the host PC is powering down, it will stop sending out Start of Frame (SOF)
// packets to your device.  In response to this, all USB devices are supposed to decrease their power
// consumption from the USB Vbus to <2.5mA* each.  The USB module detects this condition (which according
// to the USB specifications is 3+ms of no bus activity/SOF packets) and then calls the USBCBSuspend()
// function.  You should modify these callback functions to take appropriate actions for each of these
// conditions.  For example, in the USBCBSuspend(), you may wish to add code that will decrease power
// consumption from Vbus to <2.5mA (such as by clock switching, turning off LEDs, putting the
// microcontroller to sleep, etc.).  Then, in the USBCBWakeFromSuspend() function, you may then wish to
// add code that undoes the power saving things done in the USBCBSuspend() function.
//
// Note *: The "usb_20.pdf" specs indicate 500uA or 2.5mA, depending upon device classification. However,
// the USB-IF has officially issued an ECN (engineering change notice) changing this to 2.5mA for all
// devices.  Make sure to re-download the latest specifications to get all of the newest ECNs.

 * Overview:        The host may put USB peripheral devices in low power
 *                  suspend mode (by "sending" 3+ms of idle).  Once in suspend
 *                  mode, the host may wake the device back up by sending non-
 *                  idle state signalling.
 *
 *                  This call back is invoked when a wakeup from USB suspend
 *                  is detected.
 *
 * Note:            Before returning from this function, make sure that the
 *                  oscillator settings are fully compatible with USB module
 *                  operation.
 *                  If using the two-speed startup feature, wakeup and execution
 *                  will occur before the main oscillator + PLL has had a chance
 *                  to start.  Device will run from INTOSC (no PLL).  However, the
 *                  USB module cannot be clocked and receive correct USB data when
 *                  it is not clocked with the correct frequency clock source.
 *                  Therefore, when using two-speed startup, should execute software
 *                  delay to prevent any other code from executing until the main
 *                  oscillator is ready.
 *                  The host will allow at least 10ms for USB "resume recovery", during
 *                  which it will not try to communicate with the device.
